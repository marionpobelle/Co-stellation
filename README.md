Take a little break from your hectic day to gaze at the stars!

CoStellation is the result of a 3 and a half day workshop with the objective to create an interactive experience with basic inputs (keyboard, mouse, joystick) but outputs would not be limited to a computer screen.

CoStellation was presented during the 2024 edition of the ‚ÄúLes Myc√©liades‚Äù festival held at the Alpha media-library in Angoul√™me.

## Development

This game was made using [Unity](https://unity.com/fr).

Using a projector, a mirror, leds and scraps, we built a tent that immerses the player in the atmosphere of an evening watching the starry sky.

The experience isn't limited to observation: the player also has a joystick that they can use to draw their own constellations! Placed in the tent, a notebook allows players to draw and name their creation, so that future players can find it.
We left the game to run in one of the school's rooms on the Friday afternoon following the workshop. Here's the result !
